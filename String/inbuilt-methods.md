The compareTo() method compares two strings lexicographically.

The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings.

The method returns 0 if the string is equal to the other string. 
A value less than 0 is returned if the string is less than the other string (less characters) and a value greater than 0 if the string is greater than the other string (more characters).
