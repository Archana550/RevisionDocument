- I was asked a question based on a tree, which I solved in 25-30 minutes, along with answering follow-up questions.
-  telephonic call which started with introduction and further expanded to basics of data structures and basics of algorithms, time and space complexities implementation of **heap sort and heapify function.**

-  It was hangout call after 2 weeks which consisted of two questions
One was **postfix expression evaluation and implementation of queue using two stacks without built in function**. After that I got another mail for next interview.

- He asked me various questions time and space then jumped straight into question
One was **rat in maze problem** and another was generation of possible palindrome form string but should constraint other constraints.I believed in my own dreams and followed.

-  I got a call from a recruiter who asked about my work experience. She also asked some basic questions on complexity, worst case and best case for certain sorting algorithms.
